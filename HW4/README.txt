1. REPO FOR CODE AND DATASETS CAN BE FOUND HERE: https://github.com/anaqvi2/CS7641/tree/master/HW4

1. All the data an examples come from the modules and are referenced in the code, therefore nothing needs to be downloaded, moved, or renamed.
2. The code for this analysis is a jupyter notebook (HW4_FULL_CODE.ipynb), I generate both problems, and perform the analysis for both problems inside the same notebook
3. For the notebook to run, we need all required python libraries: mdpToolbox, gym, numpy, csv, decimal, and matpoltlib and their dependancies and other base python libraries
4. After all libraries are properly installed, including the correct versions, pressing run all should complete the entire analysis from start to end.
