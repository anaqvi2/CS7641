REPO FOR CODE AND DATASETS CAN BE FOUND HERE: https://github.com/anaqvi2/CS7641/tree/master/HW2

1. No Data is required Breast Cancer Dataset Can be pulled directly frrom Sklearn Libary
2. All Libraies need to be installed, including Mlrose, and ABAGAIL. 
Make sure to have the correct version of JAVA and ant installed.
3. Install Jython, Python Version of Java
4. Make Sure Abagail Jar is in the same folder
5. Run Each individual Problem domain file:
Jython Knapsack.py
Jython tsp.py
Jython continues_peaks.py
6. Output for each will be a csv files, as ABAGAIL does not work well with pandas
7. After all 3 Problem Domains have run
Python3 plotter.py
This will create the various plots found in the paper
8. Lastly run
python3 nn.py

This will run the weight calculations for the neural network for the breast cancer dataset. 
The output will be a pandas dataframe, copy the pandas dataframe one by one and enter it into excel to generate the graphs. 

GA will take a long time and may not even finish. Please keep that in mind.
